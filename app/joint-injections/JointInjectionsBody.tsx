  "At Reno Regenerative Medicine, we offer joint injections to those patients struggling with joint pain.",
  "Joint pain can occur in any joint of the body, but most patients who experience joint pain tend to feel it in certain areas such as the wrists, knees, hips, or shoulders. Acute joint pain is typically the result of an injury or direct trauma while chronic joint pain can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.",
  "Persistent and/or severe pain that prohibits your ability to complete everyday tasks should be evaluated by a doctor. If you notice redness, joint deformity, swelling, or reduced range of motion, it is time to schedule an appointment.",
  "If over-the-counter medications and physical therapy prove unable to relieve your pain, we may then proceed with another method of treatment such as joint injections. This non-surgical treatment option can not only help you experience pain relief, but can also provide increased range of motion which can also aid in making physical therapy more comfortable.",
  "Every injection in our office is performed using ultrasound guidance. Rather than relying on landmarks alone, we use real-time ultrasound imaging to guide the needle precisely into the targeted joint or soft tissue. This in-office ultrasound guidance improves accuracy, helps protect surrounding structures, and gives you the best chance at meaningful, lasting relief from a single visit.",

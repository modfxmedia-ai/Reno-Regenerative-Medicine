      "I started coming here due to feeling constantly tired and sluggish and after a blood test, they found out I have low testosterone. They started me on treatment immediately and WOW! What a difference it makes. I\u2019m so impressed by how much better I feel. I now tell every guy who tells me they feel tired to get checked for low T-levels. Thank you Kellie, Khara, and Karli so much for helping me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

      "I wasn\u2019t holding big expectations when I had the initial interview for treatment. However that was the last resource I had after having lumbar and cervical pain for two years.\n\nAll I want to say is that the treatment was explained with pros and cons from the beginning and I decided to take the risk on spending money towards my well being.\n\nI do not regret the investment on me! the treatment has been the best I have taken! lumbar or cervical surgery is not on the future as all pain from herniated disks are not bothering anymore, I feel rejuvenated and energetic as I was on my 30\u2019s, all I can say is WOW!\n\nI thank all the staff at Reno Regenerative Medicine for the support, the laughs and their support on my recovery!",

      "I have suffered for years with pain in my hands. I have consulted with several doctors and the last recommendation is to have surgery on both my hands. Because of my decision not to have surgery I continued having pains and not have good use of both my hands until I attended a seminar offered by the Reno Regenerative Medicine. Although the treatment was not covered by my insurance i decided to take the chance and get treated. I would have to say it was the best decision I ever made. With six weeks of treatment, I can feel significant changes in both my hands. Most of the pain the burning, tingling, tightness and numbness have been greatly reduced. Together with the treatment comes a diet that I have followed strictly and I have also noticed that I feel healthier. My total experience is life changing and I feel great not having to bear the pains in my hands everyday. I\u2019m so glad to have found this place to take care of my issues and avoid surgery. I would like to thank all the staff & nurses who are all exceptionally caring. I highly highly recommend Reno Regenerative Medicine.",
